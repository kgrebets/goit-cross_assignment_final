# Final Project ‚Äî Boxes App

## üìå Overview
This project is an improved version of the **Boxes App** developed during the course.  
The goal was not to build an app from scratch, but to **bring the existing product to a new level of quality, usability, and functionality**.

The app allows users to create boxes, view their details, generate and scan QR codes for quick access, and share box information.
